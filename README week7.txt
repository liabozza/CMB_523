Title of Dataset: Bozza_updated_Data_analysis_take_home_week_7(2)
The purpose of this assignment was to get practice using models available in train. A tutorial and practice piece of the homework was provided by Dr. Fisk, who coded the hard things that we have not learned yet, and the student part of the homework was adding pieces to it using things we've learned in lecture and can quickly understand with a stackoverflow search.
The data was from benign and malignant classified breast tumors from different hospitals based on many parameters like margin or area, radius, compactness. The first 100 rows of samples were split from the entire set of rows to make it easier to visualize and interpret.
